=========

This is an evolving piece of code that implements the testing code in this paper:

@InProceedings{ChenICCV2013,
  author       = "Xinlei Chen and Abhinav Shrivastava and Abhinav Gupta",
  title        = "NEIL: Extracting Visual Knowledge from Web Data",
  booktitle    = "International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)",
  year         = "2013",
  
}


Currently, the repo contains code for applying the models trained from NEIL (http://neil-kb.com/) given a new testing image, the output could be used as semantic features.
